<!-- This paper gives the first polynomial-time algorithm for the minimum 4-partition problem of submodular functions. 
In this paper, we study the colorability of a special kind of planar graph. 
A graph $G$ is called $(d_1,\dots,d_r)$-colorable if its vertex set can be partitioned into $r$ sets $V_1,\dots,V_r$ such that the maximum degree of the induced subgraph $G[V_i]$ of $G$ is at most $d_i$ for $i\in {1,\dots,r}$. 
The problem we study is a variant of famous Steinbergâ€™s conjecture. Steinberg conjectured that every planar graph without $4$-cycles and $5$-cycles are $(0,0,0)$-colorable. Unfortunately, the conjecture does not hold. Based on it, there are a large number of research results. It is known that every planar graph without $4$-cycles and $5$-cycles is $(3,4)$-colorable or $(2,6)$-colorable. 
In this paper, we reduce the gap by proving that every planar graph without $4$-cycles and $5$-cycles is $(3,3)$-colorable.  -->
